# Jupyter notebooks from my YouTube videos

Do you enjoy my YouTube channel (https://YouTube.com/reuvenlerner)?  If so, then you've probably noticed I use Jupyter a lot.  This repo contains the notebooks from some of my videos.  As I do more videos, I'll add more notebooks here.

If you have comments about my videos, or suggestions for topics I can/should address in the future, please let me know at [@reuvenmlerner on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reuvenmlerner) or via e-mail at [reuven@lerner.co.il](mailto:reuven@lerner.co.il).
